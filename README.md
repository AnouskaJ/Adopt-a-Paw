# Adopt-a-Paw

Adopt-a-Paw is a centralized web application aimed at streamlining the pet adoption process, providing detailed pet information, and offering valuable care resources. This project aims to increase successful adoptions, promote responsible pet ownership, and ensure the well-being of adopted animals.

## Problem Statement

Individuals often face challenges in finding suitable pets for adoption and navigating the adoption process. Shelters struggle to connect with potential adopters and provide comprehensive pet information. Additionally, pet owners lack reliable resources for pet care and training.

## Solution

Adopt-a-Paw proposes a solution to these problems by developing a centralized web application with a city-specific filter. The application will simplify the pet adoption process, provide detailed information about available pets, and offer valuable resources for pet care. By doing so, it will increase the chances of successful adoptions and promote responsible ownership while ensuring the well-being of adopted animals.

## Features

- **Centralized Web App**: The Adopt-a-Paw web application will serve as a one-stop platform for pet adoption, providing a user-friendly interface for potential adopters, shelters, and current pet owners.

- **Detailed Pet Information**: The application will provide comprehensive information about available pets, including their breed, age, health condition, and behavior. It will also showcase photos and videos of the pets to give users a better understanding of their personalities.

- **Valuable Care Resources**: Adopt-a-Paw will offer a range of resources for pet care, including articles, guides, and videos on topics such as pet nutrition, training, grooming, and general well-being. These resources will help pet owners provide the best care for their furry friends.

- **Success Stories**: The application will feature success stories of previous adoptions, highlighting the positive impact of adoption and encouraging potential adopters to consider giving a loving home to a shelter animal.

- **City-Specific Filter**: Adopt-a-Paw will include a city-specific filter to accurately display pets available for adoption in a particular location. This filter will make it easier for users to find pets that are accessible to them.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Development**: React.js
- **Backend Development**: Elixir
- **API Generation and Connection**: Phoenix framework of Elixir
- **Database Integration**: Ecto (Elixir's database wrapper)
- **Database Management System**: PostgreSQL

## Target Audience

- Potential Pet Adopters: Individuals who are looking to adopt a pet and provide them with a loving home.
- Animal Shelters and Rescues: Organizations that facilitate pet adoptions and require a platform to connect with potential adopters.
- Current Pet Owners: People who already have pets and can benefit from the care resources and community features offered by the application.

## Future Scope

The Adopt-a-Paw project has the potential for expansion and improvement. Here are some future scope possibilities:

- **In-App Messaging and Communication**: Adding a messaging feature to facilitate communication between adopters and shelters, allowing them to discuss adoption details and arrange meet-ups.

- **Collaborations with Veterinarians and Trainers**: Partnering with veterinary clinics and professional trainers to provide expert advice and services to pet owners through the application.

- **Integration with Social Platforms**: Integrating with popular social platforms to allow users to share adoption stories, pet updates, and connect with other pet owners in the community.

## Getting Started

To get started with Adopt-a-Paw, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the frontend development environment using React.js.
3. Set up the backend development environment using Elixir and Phoenix framework.
4. Connect the frontend and backend by generating APIs with Phoenix framework.
5. Integrate the database management system, PostgreSQL, using Ecto.
6. Customize the application according to your specific requirements.
7. Test the application thoroughly.
8. Deploy the application to a hosting platform to make it accessible to users.

## Conclusion

Adopt-a-Paw aims to revolutionize the pet adoption process by providing a centralized platform that connects potential adopters with shelters and offers valuable resources for pet care. By leveraging technology and promoting responsible pet ownership, Adopt-a-Paw strives to ensure the well-being of adopted animals while bringing joy to the lives of both pets and their owners.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
