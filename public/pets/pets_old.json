She likes to cuddle when she is sleepy and also when she wakes up from a nap. As long as she has her toys, she keeps herself active and busy during the day. Would recommend you spend at least half an hour every night to play with her as it is her normal routine now. Would recommend that you house her alone as a single cat or with another kitten. She has had her second vaccination and deworming and needs another one next month. Serious adopters only please. Looking for a good forever home for Kali. For more info/photos please whatsapp",

We are looking for working Malaysians or Malaysian families to adopt her. Angel was rather timid and shy when she was a younger kitten but we've seen her blossom in the last few weeks. She is really loving towards her siblings. Note : We put her up for adoption earlier but when the potential adopter failed to turn up, we decided to wait until she is at least two months old and emotionally more ready before putting up for adoption. Please Whatsapp me if you are interested. It is easier for me to keep track of the potential adopter via Whatsapp. I apologise if some of you have contacted me before and I was unable to get back to you. Sometimes it takes more than a week before potential adopters failed to turn up and I would have lost the contacts by then.",

After two months if feeding them with food n vitamin, they have delivered 10 healthy n lovely puppies in total - Wanna Try Puppydum? Adopt 1!

He was a little weaker than the rest because he was the runt of the litter but he's been receiving treatment and is finally ready to embark on the journey of adoption!

    "Description": "Charlie was rescued by dogs! A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please. I want Charlie to be loved his whole life :)",

He was terrified of people but gradually warmed up to her after she fed him some food & he would wait outside her house at the same time every day for food. One day he didn't show up. When he finally showed up again, he had a large terrible wound on his neck. He was in so much pain and had tears in his eyes. She brought him to the vet and found out his wound had become infested with maggots. The vet treated him and she brought him home and nursed him back to health for over a month. The wound has now completely healed but unfortunately she is unable to keep him. He is estimated to be 10 years old but is still strong & healthy. We are unsure about his breed. He is very obedient & easy to care for. This precious angel has gone through a lot & really needs a loving home.",

He needs someone that will treat him like part of the family and the sweet dog he is. He grew up with 2 cats and another small dog. he loves cats however it takes him awhile to respond well to new dogs. He never really socialized with children before, so if you have kids I would suggest meeting Kaiser with them before making a decision.He grew up mostly as an indoor dog but can do well outside if there is a shady place for him to relax during the hot parts of the day. NO Cage, No chain! please note that Kaiser is a family pet not guard dog. Kaiser is a pure breed rottweiler, he has his MKA certificate, basic dog obedience training certificate and a good citizens award metal. He also knows almost all the tricks: sit, stay, shake etc.and is a super fast learner. The reason I have to give him up for adaption is, Im an expat who was living in Malaysia for 5 years, I had to leave and unfortunately I was unable to take Kaiser with me (his breed was band in the country I moved to). I'm looking for someone to give him a permanent loving home. Kaiser is one of those dogs that crave that best friend relationship with his owner. so if you think he sounds like a good match for you please email me. my number is not available as I am out of the country, Kaiser is staying with my friend in Selangor for now.",

Preferably owner with experience in caring dog, and have an well environment for him to stay around. 4. Cannot always cage it and have to update me its latest status. Once a while have a meet up. If you agree with the T&C, you may send me following details: -Occupation -Address -Contact number -Currently have how many dogs -Breed -Photos of your dog *Short listed person have to arrange time to bring your dog meet up with Oscar see whether they can play together or not.",

I foster them for a night with Pet's own milk. Then handed over to Kah Yein (founder of animalcare.org)to foster for more than a month now. She became the fosterer & did a fantastic job as the Blueys are almost equal in size not as before, one healthier & bigger & the other is weaker & smaller. They have been dewormed, examined by the vet, vaccinated & given a clean bill of health. The Blueys are up for adoption. They need to be adopted together. They need each other for company and as playmates. They need each other's warmth as well. Fosterer criterion for adoption: Love them as much as you love yourself. She only has one pledge \"Please be committed to loving and caring for them for their entire lifetime\". Home must be landed. Must have good history with cats. Blueys must be kept indoor at all times. Should be fed premium food ( no Whiskas, Friskies kibbles if possible) Must have a steady vet clinic for health follow up & emergencies.",

We were too late to neutered Miao Miao and found she is pregnant again. 12 cats in the house are just too much for us to handle. We love the kittens very much, but we have to find future good owner for them for their better future, as we can't provide them enough attention to each of them. This batch of kittens is mixed bengal. as their father is mixed bengal and their mother is DSH calico. All kittens are healthy, active , and fun loving. Their will definitely cheer you up, when u see them playing around. All kittens are litter-trained, and feed on \"orijen\" kibble. Adoption fees is FOC, but we would ask few question to access if you are the suitable adopter for the kittens. You can adopt 1 or as pair of kittens.

    "Description": "Three gorgeous medium length hair cats rescued from a roadside in setapak. Snowy is the mama cat. She has greyish black fur with a white undercoat. I don't know how else to describe it. She looks dark grey but if you brush her fur up its all white underneath.. She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. Although I do volunteer with the Selangor SPCA in my free time, I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Interested parties can text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.",

I sprang him from the pound and realised that the streets are no longer for him, so Harvey is looking for a loving, warm home where he can enjoy pets, plays and lots of cuddles every day. He's a super smart doggie and he knows how to sit, stay, play ball and fetch. If you would like to adopt a life long super adorable doggie, please contact me to follow up. update - - Harvey is still looking for a forever home, he's currently lodging at an animal shelter, but he's still looking forwards to finding someone with a warm heart and lots of love to share his life with...",

    "Description": "When I search through the cats on petfinder for adoption, my heart sank as most cats are cuter, younger and prettier than Ninja. Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him. Anyone who likes to find out more about Ninja may drop me messages on whatsapp at (Michelle)",

    "Description": "THE PLIGHT OF OREO Oreo was approximate 3 years old when found on the side of the road in Seri kembangan, Selangor. With broken hind legs. Probably knocked by a vehicle. He was crying but no passer-by cared to rescue him. My friends from the neigbourhood and I decided to check him out after hearing his cry for a couple of days and noticed that he was an abandoned puppy with serious injuries. We quickly raised funds ourselves and sent him to the vet for operations. Now, he is as healthy and lively as any other puppy. Soon after he was healed, we put his up for adoption as my friend's parents strongly against her keeping \"Oreo\" as pet. Finally, a kind lady adopted \"Oreo\" but only for 2 weeks. She surrendered Oreo to us saying the dog is just not right for her and Oreo has lost because she was careless . Finally my friend get to found \"Oreo\" in some where. Now, we have to put Oreo up for adoption again. I really hope that a kind person with love and care for animals will adopt Oreo and give him a comfortable live. He has gone through many hardship. From being abandoned to severe injuries, then adopted to be abandoned again. If you are touched and would love to keep Oreo, a lively and active puppy of 3 years old ,please call at Shirmy or Yeng Tian . Every dog, including Oreo deserves a second chance. * Please note that the photography of Oreo was done FOC by a kind photographer, Andrew æ´‹è‘±å¤´, who pitied the plight of Oreo",

She is toilet trained to relieve herself on grass. New owner will need to spay her and give her a lot of tender loving care. She has no existing health problems. She is quite timid and might require sometime to become accustomed to new situations and people. She is not an aggressive puppy and enjoys being pampered.",

I was feeding them and keeping them company when I had the time, after leaving to Singapore for a few days, I came back to find them missing - apparently the person that was taking care of them let them go. Found these 2 puppies running around in the drain near my area scared and lost. Their skin condition is perfect according to the vet, and I have got them dewormed and vaccinated (need another 2 more vaccinations). They are extremely friendly and tame. I need to find them a home in a week. If you are looking to adopt them, please take them as a pair. The black one is extra small, and the gold one is big for his age.",

I actually intended to keep it, but since there is a conflict of interest in my house. I'm not able to do so, i hope there's a person or family that would be willing to do on my behalf. Of course you'll be granted full custody :p It's very playful, cheerful, and active cat. Does not have any trouble eating. I've train him to litter in the box, i'm sure there will be no problem on that. One last thing, when i found the cat, there is a scar on his front leg(just one side), but i'm sure it's treatable. Anybody interested, please do let me know :)",
